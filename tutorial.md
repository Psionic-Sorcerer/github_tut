# Introduction

This markdown document is a tutorial to help a team of developers get started with development via GitHub.  Step-by-step instructions are supplemented with videos and other media demonstrating the steps.

A Python program using the <code>pandas</code> package is the target for development in this tutorial, but the focus is on learning the development process in GitHub rather than learning to code with Python and <code>pandas</code>, and so a solution is provided for the code to permit this exercise to be appropriately focused.  

# The Tutorial

This is intended as a collaborative exercise, and so you will need a team of at least two people for this tutorial.  

## Establish GitHub Accounts

Any team member who does not have a GitHub account must establish one by going to [https://github.com](https://github.com)

## Create a GitHub Repository for Development

Of the team members, identify one team member who will do the following:

-  Create a repository, named <code>github_tut</code>, in which to conduct this tutorial following the steps taken in the video below.

- Get these files from xxxxxx and upload them to the <code>github_tut</code> repository (repo) at <code>https://github.com/_your_github_username_/github_tut</code>.
  - github.py
  - github_soln.py
  - DECENNIALPL2020.P1_data_with_overlays_2021-11-05T143124_mod.csv








2.	One team member should 
a.	Create a public repository named github_tut 
b.	Upload these files to that repository, which can be found https://github.com/your_github_username/github_tut
i.	github.py 
ii.	github_soln.py
iii.	DECENNIALPL2020.P1_data_with_overlays_2021-11-05T143124_mod.csv
c.	Communicate the repository URL to the other teammates
d.	Give write permission to the GitHub IDs of teammates by going to Settings>Collaborators on the GitHub web repo page.
3.	Each of the other teammates should do the following:
a.	Accept invitation (email) from repo owner
b.	Go to owner’s repo page and create new branch
c.	Clone the repository onto their computer and Open with GitHub Desktop app
d.	In GitHub Desktop navigate to the new branch you created
e.	Edit the code by completing one of the functions used to create a new column in the DataFrame programmed in the github.py file, and “un-comment” the corresponding statement used to create a new column in the DataFrame, that is, delete the pound sign
f.	Test the code revision to ensure that it works  
g.	In GitHub Desktop Commit the code change to the branch
h.	Then Push changes to Origin (repo on the Internet)
i.	In GitHub Desktop, Create Pull Request
4.	All team member should participate on a Zoom call where the team member who owns the repository reviews and approves the pull requests.
a.	Click on Pull requests in the menu at the top of the web repo page
b.	Click on the pull request to see details
c.	Click on Files Changed to see revisions
d.	Click back to Conversation
e.	Click on Merge Pull Request   
f.	Click on Confirm Merge   
g.	Click on Delete Branch   
h.
